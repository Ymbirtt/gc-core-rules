# gc-core-rules
A clone of the rulebook for the [Green Cloaks](http://www.greencloaks.co.uk/) LARP system.

Green Cloaks is a far-future science-fiction hyphen-filled live-action role-playing game, produced by Trinity Games. 

This repository contains a clone of its rulebook, converted to LaTeX, for the purposes of tracking and commenting upon balance changes. Though it is contributed to by at least one member of the ref team, it is in no way intended to reflect the current state of the rulebook, which is distributed on the [Green Cloaks website](http://www.greencloaks.co.uk/topics/66-rules). Changes made in this repository represent the views of a couple of Green Cloaks players, and may or may not ever become part of the green cloaks system.

## Contributing

Got a balance issue you want to discuss? Raise it as an issue against this repository, we'll get chatting about it.
Want to add some stuff to the rules? Fork, branch, commit, PR!
In case it wasn't clear yet, nothing in this repository actually represents the rules that are played, we're simply using it to keep track of our own opinions

## Licence

Copyrights to the original rulebook are owned wholly by Trinity Games. This represents a derivative of the original, allowing enthusiasts to easily track and suggest changes to the rules.
