Appendix H. Sample Character Builds

These are designed to give you an insight into the character creation process, and how a character might develop over time. They also highlight some of the features of different classes.

\subsection{Michael Fuller}

\textit{``When you kill, don't think too hard about it. Do your job, do it well, but don't glorify in war. Just survive, and live to enjoy another cup of tea.''}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Michael Fuller \\
 \hline Race & Human (Delmonte) \\
 \hline Regiment & Delmont 205th \\
 \hline Class & Trooper \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Starting skill points to spend: 2

\textit{Class attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tenacious}: Michael receives 2 global hits as per the Dodge skill, without the need for the skill, and it stacks if he purchases the skill.

\item \textbf{Dodged the bullet!}: Once Michael reaches Tier 3 of the Dodge skill he only needs to expend 2 dodge hits to avoid a call instead of all of them.

\item \textbf{Canny}: Once per encounter, Michael may use one additional call

from the Rifle skill, providing he already has the ability to use it. \textit{{[}If Michael purchased the Melee Weapons skill and increased it to Tier 2 he could also apply this attribute to a call from that skill.{]}}

\end{itemize}
\textit{Skills}

\textbf{Self-sufficient} Tier 1 (free regimental specialist skill).

\textbf{Rifle} Tier 2 (free starting class skill, chosen instead of Dodge or Melee Weapons; primary skill, 2 starting skill points spent to increase to Tier 2).

\textit{Hits}

Can wear up to heavy armour. 2 body hits per location.

3 armour hits per armoured location, while wearing heavy armour. 2 global hits, from the Tenacious class attribute.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Michael receives 2 skill points to spend for every event that he survives.

After his first event, Michael spends 1 point to purchase the \textbf{Courage} skill (primary skill) at Tier 1 and 1 point to purchase the \textbf{Dodge} skill (primary skill) at Tier 1. The Dodge skill grants him an additional 1 global hit, which stacks with his Tenacious class attribute to give him a total of 3 global hits.

After his second event, Michael spends 2 skill points to increase his \textbf{Courage} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2. During his second event Michael is promoted in rank to Sergeant, and given responsibility for a unit of riflemen.

Michael Fuller has joined the Green Cloaks to escape a pretty bad situation back home. Of course, with Delmont as home most things can be pretty bad, but his situation really took the biscuit. If you think that fighting the One Bakkar on the front lines is preferable to home, you know you've got it bad.

Michael is a staunch man, steadfast but weary of the world. He doesn't seem to be bothered by the act of killing another living creature, not even seeming to take any pride in a well-placed shot. It's almost like he's done it too much already, and now it's just old news. Where the younger men in his regiment return from a battle telling tales of their heroics, Michael prefers to make a cup of tea and enjoy it by the fire. But nobody interrupts his tea drinking. Woe to the enemy that attacks during that sacred time!

\subsection{Petrov Ivanovich}

\textit{``I've got all the time in the world, boss.''}

Starting skill points to spend: 1

\textit{Class attributes}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Petrov Ivanovich \\
 \hline Race & Human (Rossii) \\
 \hline Regiment & Kingskeep 98th \\
 \hline Class & Sniper \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The Tools for the Job}: Petrov is issued 5 marksman rounds as equipment at the start of every event.

\item \textbf{Keen Eye}: Petrov receives a 5-second reduction on the aiming time when using the Marksman skill.

\item \textbf{Incapacitate the Target}: Once per encounter, Petrov may use the Cripple call as per the Marksman skill, without expending any marksman rounds.

\end{itemize}
\textit{Skills}

\textbf{Stealth} Tier 1 (free regimental specialist skill).

\textbf{Rifle} Tier 1 (free class starting skill).

\textbf{Marksman} Tier 1 (free class starting skill) - it takes him 40 seconds to use the Marksman call, and 35 seconds to use the Cripple call.

\textit{{[}Snipers receive both free class starting skills at character creation, but only receive 1 skill point to spend instead of 2.{]}}

\textbf{Awareness} Tier 1 (primary skill, 1 starting skill point spent).

\textit{Hits}

Can wear up to medium armour. 2 body hits per location.

2 armour hits per armoured location, while wearing medium armour.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Petrov receives 2 skill points to spend for every event he survives.

After his first event, Petrov spends his 2 skill points to increase his \textbf{Marksman} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2. This means his time required to use the Marksman and Cripple calls has decreased by a further 5 seconds. After his second event, he spends his 2 skill points to increase his \textbf{Rifle} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2, allowing him to use the calls Through or Stun once per encounter.

Growing up on Rossi can be harsh and dangerous. If the bears don't kill you, the vodka, cold, or women might. Every Rossii has his or her own way of surviving, and for Petrov it was to not be seen, stay unnoticed, and just get on with what you're doing. Like many young men he emigrated to Ardheim as soon as he was old enough (whereupon he was disappointed to find that Ardheim also had bears), and not long after enlisted in the Ardheim Defence Force. Showing promise as a rifleman, he was sent for training at the Keep, where due to his patient nature and keen eye he excelled as a sniper. While others in his unit picked up roundshields and melee weapons, heading off into the forests of Ardheim to cut the tree that would become their own shield, Petrov just practiced with his rifle. Eventually he was put forward for the final training and the test of the Keep, which he passed with flying colours{\dots} almost. If it hadn't have been for the bear he'd not have had to take that out first, losing 3 seconds on his time for the actual target. Damn bears. Nevertheless, he was one of the few who passed the training, and was immediately sent to the front lines to serve in Kingskeep 98th.

Dana O'Malley

\textit{``Don't you dare die on me. If you do, I'll kill you!''}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Dana O'Malley \\
 \hline Race & Human (Marazionite) \\
 \hline Regiment & 23rd Heavy Infantry \\
 \hline Class & Medic \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Starting skill points to spend: 2

\textit{Skills}

\textbf{\textit{Class attributes}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Medical Supplies}: Dana is issued with an additional 2 dermograft patches at the start of every event (total 3).

\item \textbf{Medical Researcher}: Dana can undertake Pharmacology research.

\item \textbf{Deathwatch}: Dana can diagnose a dying character, allowing them to tell her what their death count is.

\item \textbf{Triage}: Dana can lead up to 2 other people with the Medicae skill in a triage team to decrease the time it takes to stabilise and heal people.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Heavy Weapons} Tier 1 (free regimental specialist skill).

\textbf{Medicae} Tier 1 (free starting class skill).

\textbf{Courage} Tier 1 (primary skill, 1 starting skill point spent).

\textbf{Pharmacology} Tier 1 (primary skill, 1 starting skill point spent).

\textit{Hits}

Can wear up to medium armour. 2 body hits per location.

armour hits per armoured location, while wearing medium armour.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Dana receives 2 skill points to spend for every event that she survives.

She uses the 2 skill points she receives after her first event to increase her \textbf{Medicae} skill to Tier 2, further reducing the time it takes her to stabilise and heal characters. With the 2 skill points she receives after her second event, she purchases \textbf{Bulging Biceps} at Tier 1, a secondary skill for Medics. This allows her to use a shield to protect herself and her patients, but she also intends to increase it to Tier 3 over the next couple of events, to make it easier for her to grapple and move people who are injured away from the front lines.

At her first event Dana is promoted to Sergeant and Chief Medic of the 23rd. At her third event she

becomes Captain of the regiment and passes on the Chief Medic role to a promising recruit.

Dana likes to be good at a great number of things, and indeed she can mow you down in a rain of bullets, craft pharmaceuticals and invent new ones, stitch you up and stop you dying, and what's more is that she is completely unafraid. Little fazes her, and she can routinely be found stomping around the battlefield roughly tending to the wounded, talking frightened soldiers into heading back into the fray, giving orders, and pouring pharmaceuticals down her allies' throats. She accepts no weakness, scolds hesitation, but makes you feel like a big damn hero when you're bleeding out on the ground and she's stitching you up.

\subsection{Krakkt}

\textit{``Here, I bought you the head of the man that looked at you funny yesterday.''}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Krakkt \\
 \hline Race & Mascen \\
 \hline Regiment & Kingskeep 98th \\
 \hline Class & Big'un \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Starting skill points to spend: 3

\textit{Skills}

\textbf{\textit{Class attributes}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tough Hide}: Krakkt receives 1 extra body hit per location.

\item \textbf{Unwavering}: Krakkt receives 1 extra Fear resist per encounter, as per the Courage skill, without needing the skill.

\item \textbf{Unstoppable}: Twice per day, Krakkt may enter a state of pure rage for 10 seconds, during which all damage taken is delayed until the rage has finished.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Melee} Tier 1 (free class starting skill).

\textbf{Courage} Tier 2 (primary skill, 1 starting skill point spent to purchase Tier 1, 2 starting skill points spent to increase to Tier 2).

\textit{Hits}

May wear up to heavy armour.

body hits per location (2 standard, 1 extra from Tough Hide class attribute). 3 armour hits per armoured location, while wearing heavy armour.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Krakkt receives 2 skill points to spend for each event she survives.

She chooses to spend her first 2 skill points to increase her \textbf{Melee Weapons} skill (primary) to Tier 2 so that she can use the Knockdown call once per day with her two-handed chainsword. After her second event, Krakkt spends 1 skill point to purchase the \textbf{Bulging Biceps} skill (primary skill) at Tier 1, and 1 skill point to purchase the \textbf{Extra Hits} skill (primary skill) at Tier 1. Although using a two-handed weapon removes the possibility of using a shield, she is considering other uses of the Bulging Biceps skill, such as picking up bodies or carrying people.

Although may people approach Krakkt with caution and a little fear, when you get to know her she is one of the most loyal and caring people you'll meet. Not caring in the way of offering a shoulder to cry on, or asking after your health, but caring in the way of completely obliterating any threat that comes near you, and wallowing in the blood of your mutual enemies. She's larger than life, into everything, and completely overwhelming. She doesn't talk about herself much, and despite coming across as unintelligent she has an uncanny knack of flawlessly changing the subject if somebody asks her about her past.

\subsection{Ana}

\textit{``I observe, I learn, I will report back.''}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Ana \\
 \hline Race & Vrede \\
 \hline Regiment & Delmont 205th \\
 \hline Class & N/a (vrede) \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Starting skill points to spend: 3

\textit{Class attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Can't Take it With You}: Ana cannot wear armour.

\item \textbf{Vrede-tech light energy shield}: + 4 global hits.

\item \textbf{Vrede-tech rifle}: Ana can use this to make one of the following calls once per encounter: Through, Stun, Knockdown or Disarm.

\item \textbf{Tech-minded}: Ana can undertake Engineering research.

\item \textbf{Chief Engineer}: Ana can lead up to 2 other people who also have the Engineering skill on a project or task.

\item \textbf{Teaching}: Ana can teach others with the Engineering skill how to craft tech items, but can only teach vrede-tech to other vrede.

\end{itemize}
\textit{Skills}

\textbf{Engineering} Tier 2 (free class starting skill for Tier 1, chosen instead of Rifle; primary skill, 2 starting skill

points spent to increase to Tier 2).

\textbf{Rifle} Tier 1 (primary skill, 1 starting skill point spent).

\textit{Hits}

2 body hits per location (standard).

4 global hits (from vrede-tech light energy shield).

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Ana receives 2 skill points to spend for every event she survives.

She spends the 2 points she earned from her first event to purchase a veteran pick, \textbf{Stealth}. As this is her first veteran pick it only costs her 2 points. After the next event she uses her 2 skill points to increase her \textbf{Rifle} skill to Tier 2.

Part of the 25th generation of the vrede collective, Ana has been sent to join the Terran Sovereignty Army on the front lines to act as a source of information for the collective as to the activities of the other races in the war against the One Bakkar. Although she is a highly skilled engineer, Ana often prefers to spend her time interacting with members of the different regiments. She views all information as a vital resource, and every interaction as a resource-gathering exercise. Over time she realises that the other races often attempt crude forms of subterfuge and secrecy, and so she takes the Stealth skill as a veteran pick to allow her to observe these information exchanges also.

\subsection{Draszz}

\textit{``If you know how to heal, you know how to hurt.''}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline 
Name & Draszz \\
 \hline Race & Tae'go \\
 \hline Regiment & 109th Light Infantry \\
 \hline Class & N/a (tae'go) \\
 \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Starting skill points to spend: 3

\textit{Class attributes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bilious}: Draszz may spit on a melee weapon twice per day so that with the next strike he uses either the Sleep or Paralyse call.

\item \textbf{Ranger}: Draszz may look for, or cover, tracks in an area.

\item \textbf{Fox Step}: Draszz may move while using the Stealth skill for an extra 2 seconds.

\textit{{[}Draszz does not have the Pharmacology skill, so does not receive the class attribute that allows him to undertake Pharmacology research.{]}}

\end{itemize}
\textit{Skills}

\textbf{Stealth} Tier 1 (free class starting skill).

\textbf{Backstab} Tier 1 (primary skill; 1 point of starting skill points spent).

\textbf{Medicae} Tier 1 (secondary skill; 2 starting skill points spent).

\textit{Hits}

Can wear up to medium armour. 2 body hits per location.

2 armour hits per armoured location while wearing medium armour.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Draszz receives 2 skill points to spend for every event that he survives.

He spends the skill points he earned from his first event to increase his \textbf{Stealth} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2. After the next event he spends the 2 skill points he receives to increase his \textbf{Backstab} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2.

Trained from a young age in the tae'go ways of war, Draszz has become a skilled guerilla fighter. Like his father

before him, and several of his brothers and sisters, he has fought with the same blades as the ancients used

- sharp, cruel knives notched along the blade to allow the venomous bile of the tae'go to pool and hold to the blade more effectively. Since joining the Terran Sovereignty Army, Draszz has excelled at covert operations, and is often called upon to take out a single, high-risk target using his stealth and ability to find the single chink in an enemy's armour. His tribe taught him the healing arts, and Draszz uses his medical knowledge not only to heal his allies but also as a way of further understanding the workings of the body: with this knowledge he hopes he may be able to discover new, more efficient ways of taking down a target.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Inky receives 2 skill points to spend for every event that she survives.

Inky chooses to only spend 1 of the 2 skill points she earns after her first event, and purchases the \textbf{Self- sufficient} skill at Tier 1. This allows her to make use of her Resourceful class attribute. She saves the remaining 1 skill point for later use.

After her next event she receives 2 skill points, giving her a total of 3 to spend. She uses them to purchase the \textbf{Omega Mind Attunement}, at Tier 1, which costs her 2 points because it is a secondary skill. She could spent her remaining skill point to purchase \textbf{Dodge} at Tier 1, a primary skill for her class, but doesn't intend to get into a situation where she would need it, so chooses to save the skill point for the future.

Inky is a young mascen, full of excitement and enthusiasm, and with an inquisitive nature. She particularly enjoys being inquisitive about people, and finds their minds fascinating - especially when she can use the power of the Omega to delve into them and root around. Such interesting, funny things are kept in there! Such secret, hidden things too. Two years ago, Inky still lived with her tribe and was learning how to direct and control her connection to the Omega from an elder; she was going to take over the role of elder shaman when her teacher passed on, but she had also grown up listening to the stories of the slavery of her people, and what was at stake in the war against the One Bakkar. With the blessing of her elder and family, she chose to join the Terran Sovereignty Army, and use her gifts to ensure that her people would never be enslaved again.

BOOM! receives 2 skill points to spend for every event he survives.

He uses the 2 points he receives from his first event to purchase the \textbf{Explosives} skill (secondary skill) at Tier 1. After the next event he uses 1 of his 2 points to purchase the \textbf{Pistol} skill (primary skill) at Tier 1. He chooses to save the remaining 1 point, as he is planning on increasing his Explosives skill to Tier 2 next time, which will cost him 3 points.

The 23rd Heavy Infantry originally thought that they had been lumbered with this individual, and at first tried to stay away from him as much as possible. His over-eagerness to take apart their weapons and ``improve'' them was unsettling, especially when the improvements were a little enthusiastic (that lightning gun didn't quite work out{\dots} but the flame-thrower chainsaw did. Nobody uses it these days though. It gets locked away.). They also weren't sure about his penchant for scrabbling about in people's rubbish, or picking up everything he found. But when he started showing them, with delight, what treasures he had discovered on these foraging expeditions, explaining - with that nervous twitch of his left shoulder and eye when he got particularly excited

- how they could be used, they began to see him as a valuable asset. As time went on BOOM! decided that he quite enjoyed the sound that his inventions made when they went wrong, and undertook explosives training with the regiment. Adding a pistol to his stash of things that make loud sounds, BOOM! discovered that he rather enjoyed the battlefield, with all its myriad sounds and the smell of guns, twisting metal and oil.

\textit{Character progression after two events}

Maeyuki receives 2 skill points to spend for every event she survives.

After her first event, she uses the 2 points to increase her \textbf{Medicae} skill (primary skill) to Tier 2.

After her second event, she decides she needs more focus points per day, so she spends her 2 skill points on purchasing her first veteran pick, the \textbf{Focus} skill (giving her an additional 3 focus points per day, for a total of 18).

It seems strange to many people that a woman like Maeyuki would have volunteered to join the Green Cloaks on the front lines, especially in the 23rd Heavy Infantry. She is graceful, gentle, and soft-spoken, and wears clothing in the style of the myr'na people, in her family colours: sky-blue and white. Her only deference to the need for armour is a ballistic-weave cloak that she wears, which gives her a little bit of protection. She carries no weapons, despite the insistence of her colonel. However, Maeyuki is philosophical about the battlefield: this is where she has chosen to be, and can can only trust in her choice. To doubt, or fear, is a futile exercise.

She has chosen to attach herself to the 23rd Heavy Infantry as she believes that they can most benefit from her healing skills. She finds their brash attitudes distasteful, and does not socialise with them, nor take their offers of alcohol, seeking out instead the company of other myr'na where she can. However, she respects their commemoration of their dead, and one day she hopes that her name also will be spoken in remembrance around their fire.

\textbf{Figure 5}: using trees and taller undergrowth for the Stealth skill. The person in the top left is \textbf{not} in stealth, as although the undergrowth here provides more than 50\% cover they are standing, and must be crouched or lower for it to count as stealth. The other two figures are both in stealth, as the undergrowth provides more than 50\% coverage of their size from at least one side, and they are in a crouched position or lower.

\textbf{Appendix J.} \textbf{\textit{Blastersmiths UK}} \textbf{Blaster Safety Guidelines}

\subsection{Blaster Standards}

In the interests of openness and fairness, we have laid out the standards that all blasters must adhere to, either mechanically or electrically.

Physical condition

Sharp edges and cracked plastic are not permitted: while melee striking and blocking with a blaster are banned, accidents can happen, therefore a blaster should not have sharp edges that may accidentally harm a person in this situation. Blasters that use a spring to provide power should be inspected for signs of stress if the spring has been upgraded. Particular areas of stress will be highlighted by white stress marks in the ABS plastic.

Firing capability

The blaster must be able to fire approved ammunition (see point \textit{2.2 Dart Types}) at a target. Whether or not it hits the target is irrelevant.

Muzzle velocity

The system uses a chronograph to measure the velocity (speed) of darts when they leave the muzzle of a blaster. The upper limit is 130 feet per second (39.62 metres per second). For comparison's sake, a stock (unmodified) Nerf Retaliator fires at about 65 feet per second (19.81 metres per second).

Wiring standards

The standards require that all joins are insulated with either heat shrink tubing (HST, preferred) or electrical tape. Hot glue insulation is not permitted. If a blaster has been rewired by a system-approved outfit (currently either \textit{Blastersmiths UK} or \textit{UKNerfWar}) then it passes the wiring safety standards. Otherwise, photos of the internals must be presented to the safety checker. If no such photos are available, the blaster will be opened by the player and inspected by the safety checker to ensure compliance. Blasters that are not electrical (or only have a small integrated torch, eg the Firestrike), or electrical blasters that are not modified, do not need to be opened. Evidence of intact seals may be required in order to verify modification status.

Battery standards

All batteries should be within a hard plastic case - typically the blaster's battery tray. A pack of silica gel (which absorbs moisture) is strongly recommended to ward against condensation and light rain.

\textit{AA alkalines, NiMH rechargeables and similar}

These cells should in good condition and not be leaking. In the case of NiMH, each cell should read roughly 1.2V while alkalines should read 1.5V. Often, white crusting or similar discolouration will indicate a problem with a battery. Any batteries in poor condition must be replaced in order for the blaster to be deemed safe.

\textit{TrustFire}

Extra care must be taken when handling TrustFire batteries: they are safe for use in the system but with a number of caveats. The only permitted brand of TrustFire battery is the ocial, silver-wrapped version.

Ultrareds and non-branded cells are not permitted. They must be checked after every engagement for symmetry of discharge - in other words that each battery has the same voltage. If they don't, they need to be charged. Nominal voltage should be 3.7V. Cells presenting at 3.4V or below need to be charged.

\textit{NiMH, NiCd and lithium battery Packs}

These must be checked for leakage and/or swelling. Lithium packs must have a voltage monitoring system

either a voltmeter, or an RC battery alarm. We recommend wrapping lithium packs in bubble wrap within the blaster's battery tray for extra protection against impacts. Lithium packs must read at least a voltage of 3.4V/cell (lithium polymer) or 3V/cell (lithium iron phosphate/LiFePO4).

\subsection{Ammunition Types}

Dart tip guide

Hard, dense-tipped full vinyl jacket (or ``FVJ'') darts are banned in the system. Without eye protection, these darts pose a serious risk of injury due to their dense, solid tip.

Dart types

Players are allowed to use the following dart types. There may often be a colour variant to tip types.

\textit{Off-the-shelf Hasbro darts}

\begin{itemize}
\item Orange ``streamlines'' - these are old, and no longer for sale, but are still permitted.

\item Blue ``elites'' - these are Hasbro's current ammo standard.

\item Various ``whistler'' darts - these have a large rubber head and only function in certain pistol-sized blasters. Also old, and no longer sold.

\item Various ``tagger'' darts - these have large rubber heads and velcro on their tips. Also old, hard to come by.

\item Various ``suction'' darts - Hasbro supplies two types of suction cup dart, the older Micro Suction dart and the new, blue-bodied Universal Suction Dart.

\item Various recoloured ``elite'' darts from sub-lines - eg Zombie Strike and Rebelle.

\item Mega Darts - Hasbro's newer and larger ammo type.

\end{itemize}
\textit{Aftermarket darts}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Koosh'' darts - have a rough-looking head.

\end{itemize}
Specifically banned ammunition

Ammunition not discussed above is not permitted for use, such as Vortex (``XLR'') discs and Rebelle Arrows. All darts must be produced by an OEM manufacturer, home-made darts or modied darts are banned for use within the system. This includes, but isn't limited to, glue domes, UBER-domes and metal weighted stefans. ``Voberry'' darts / ``Voberries'' are specifically banned due to their harder heads.
